# PPCL

This is a plugin and syntax for the PPCL langauge for Sublime Text 3.

It has a syntax highliting for .pcl files.

It also has a comment toggling plugin (ctrl+/)

It auto-numbers new lines when enter is pressed
    -in increments of 10, provided the newline doesn't exceed the following line

It can auto-renumber all the lines with ctrl+shift+l
    - this asks for the beginning line number and the increment amount in the form
    100:10

Known bugs
1) toggling comments needs some work
2) the line numbering input works the following time, not immediately.  hard to describe, but annoying
